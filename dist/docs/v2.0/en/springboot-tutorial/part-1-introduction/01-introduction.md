# Session 1: Introduction to Spring and Spring Boot

Welcome to the first session of our Spring Boot tutorial. In this session, we'll explore what the Spring ecosystem is and how Spring Boot simplifies Java development.

title: "The Philosophy of Spring"

The core idea behind Spring and Spring Boot is to make developers' lives easier by handling the boilerplate and infrastructure, allowing them to focus on business logic. This is achieved through principles like Dependency Injection and Convention over Configuration.
```

## What is the Spring Framework?

Spring is a powerful open-source framework for building robust enterprise applications in Java. Its main goal is to simplify the development of large-scale Java applications by promoting good practices like Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and Inversion of Control (IoC). It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is an evolution of the Spring Framework that makes it even easier to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can "just run". It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

### Key Features

items:
  - icon: "RocketIcon"
    title: "Opinionated 'starter' dependencies"
    content: "Simplifies your build configuration by providing a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application."
  - icon: "SettingsIcon"
    title: "Automatic Configuration"
    content: "Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the JAR dependencies you have added. For example, if `HSQLDB` is on your classpath, and you have not manually configured any database connection beans, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database."
  - icon: "ServerIcon"
    title: "Embedded Servers"
    content: "Easily build applications with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow directly. You don't need to deploy WAR files."
  - icon: "TrendingUpIcon"
    title: "Production-Ready Features"
    content: "Provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration out of the box."
