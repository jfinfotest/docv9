# Project Guides

This section provides quickstart guides for setting up your documentation project based on your versioning and internationalization needs. Each guide will show you how to configure `constants.ts`, structure your folders, and create your `file-manifest.json`.

Choose the guide that best fits your use case:
- **[Basic Project](./01-basic-project.md)**: For simple documentation with no versions or languages.
- **[Versioned Project](./02-versioned-project.md)**: If you need to maintain documentation for multiple product versions.
- **[Multilingual Project](./03-multilingual-project.md)**: If you need to offer your documentation in multiple languages.
- **[Combined Project](./04-combined-project.md)**: The most comprehensive setup, for multiple versions and languages.
