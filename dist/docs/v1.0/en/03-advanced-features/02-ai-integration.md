# AI Integration (Gemini)

Power up your documentation with Google Gemini's AI features. To use them, you need a **Gemini API Key**, which you can set in the **Settings** panel.

A floating menu in the bottom-right corner of each page gives you access to these tools.

## Available Features

- **Chat with Document**: Start a conversation with an AI assistant that will answer questions based *solely* on the content of the current page. It's context-aware and will not use external knowledge, ensuring answers are relevant to your documentation.
- **Quiz Generator**: Creates a quiz with open-ended questions to test your comprehension of the document. The AI then grades your answers, providing a score and constructive feedback.
- **Glossary Generator**: Automatically scans the document to identify key terms and generates clear, concise definitions for each, based on the context provided in the text.
- **Summarizer**: Creates a concise, easy-to-read summary of the entire page, presented as a list of key bullet points.
- **Concept Simplifier**: Identifies the most complex or technical concept on the page and explains it in simple terms using a helpful analogy.
- **Code Analyzer**: Allows you to select any code block from the page and ask the AI to either explain what it does in plain language or translate it into another programming language.
- **Podcast Generator**: Transforms the document's content into a short audio podcast. You can choose between a single-narrator style (monologue) or a two-person conversation (dialogue) and select from various AI voices.
